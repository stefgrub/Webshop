    <p>
        Protecting your personal data is very important to us.
        This privacy policy explains how personal data is processed when using this webshop.
        The webshop is currently under development and also serves as a learning and test project.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Controller</h2>
    <p>
        Stefan Grubbauer<br>

    </p>

    <h2>2. Purpose of this Website</h2>
    <p>
        This webshop is under active development and is continuously being improved.
        Many functions (e.g. cart, orders, user accounts) are used for demonstration
        and testing only.
        The products shown are partially <strong>fictional</strong> and are used solely to present
        webshop features.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Use of AI-generated Images & Content</h2>
    <p>
        Some product images and graphics on this webshop were created with
        <strong>OpenAI / ChatGPT (image generation)</strong>.
        These AI-generated images do not contain personal data and are not based on
        uploaded photos of real persons.
    </p>
    <p>
        All AI-based images are purely illustrative and do not represent real products.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Processing of Personal Data</h2>
    <p>
        When you visit this website, only the data that is technically necessary
        to provide the service is processed. This includes in particular:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>IP address (shortened or anonymised where possible)</li>
        <li>Date and time of access</li>
        <li>Visited pages (URL, path)</li>
        <li>Browser and device information</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This data is automatically stored in server log files for security reasons
        (e.g. error analysis). There is no personal evaluation of this data.
    </p>

    <h2>5. No Real Orders / No Data Transfer</h2>
    <p>
        Even though the webshop includes order functionality, any data entered is
        stored and processed for <strong>testing purposes only</strong> and is <strong>not</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>used for advertising purposes,</li>
        <li>used for profiling,</li>
        <li>transferred to third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        There is no real contract processing.
        All products and prices displayed are examples and not binding offers.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Cookies</h2>
    <p>
        This website only uses technically necessary cookies, for example:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>session-related cookies (e.g. for cart or login simulation)</li>
        <li>a setting for the light/dark theme (design preference)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>No tracking or analytics cookies</strong> (such as Google Analytics) are used.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Contact Forms / Inputs on the Webshop</h2>
    <p>
        If you voluntarily enter data (for example in a contact form or during a
        test order), this data is processed only within the webshop and is not
        forwarded to external services.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>
        The webshop uses HTTPS to transmit data in an encrypted form.
        However, as this is a development project, full security cannot be guaranteed
        at all times, despite careful setup.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Rights under GDPR</h2>
    <p>
        Since no real, permanent processing of personal data takes place in regular
        operation, user rights such as access, deletion or rectification are only
        applicable in a limited way.
        If you still have concerns about data stored as part of testing, you can
        contact us at any time and we will review and delete such data where applicable.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This privacy policy may be updated in the future if functions of the webshop
        are extended or changed.
